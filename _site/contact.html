            <h1><b>Motivation Behind SKRT</b></h1>
            <h4><i>
            <p style="text-indent: 5em;"> SKRT was initially designed with two things in mind, simplicity and speed.
              The background of our name is originated for the streets of Atlanta, where
              trap music reigns supreme. With the rapid growth and popularity of trap music,
              many rappers began using the verbal imagery of “SKRT” which is associated
              with fast cars revving their engines and burning rubber as they Takeoff. This
              idea of the luxuriois life led us to our logo which features a Lamborghini
              ready to SKRT at any given moment.</p>

            <p style="text-indent: 5em;">SKRT was based off of the new language call “Reason”  which is a Facebook
              langued aimed at “building systems rapidly”. We felt that Javascript syntax is
              widely known amongst programmers so it would be easier to learn and apply.
              Similarly, we felt that the functional language of  OCaml had great aspects of
              type inference, pattern matching, first-class function and recursion.</p>

            <p style="text-indent: 5em;">SKRT is also loosely object-oriented, immutable and a statically-typed language.
              Other features include tuples, loops, and destructuring. It feels like JavaScript
              and works like OCaml. Our motto is ”SKRT out programs real quick, and whip onto
              the next project with skid marks” as we want to emphasize our rapid and quick
              program generation.</p>
